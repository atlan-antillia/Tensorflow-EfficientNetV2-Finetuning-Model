2. Create BreaKHis_V1_400X 

The original images (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format) of 
benign and malignant in BreakHis_v1 are stored in the different folders specified by magnifying 
factors (40X, 100X, 200X and 400X) 

For simplicity, we have selected the images in all 400X folders only, and created
BreaKHis_V1_400X dataset which contains test and train. 


BreaKHis_V1_400X
  ├─test
  │  ├─benign
  │  └─malignant
  └─train
      ├─benign
      └─malignant

If you would like to create BeaKHis_V1_400X/master dataset from 
the original dataset <b>BreaKHis_v1</b>, please move to 
>python create_BreaKHis_X400_master.py

Also, you can easily split the generated master dataset into train 
and test by running
>python split_master.py
